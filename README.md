<H1>🧠 Image Classification using CNN on CIFAR-10</H1>
This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

<H1>📦 Dataset</H1>
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains the following 10 classes:

Airplane

Automobile

Bird

Cat

Deer

Dog

Frog

Horse

Ship

Truck

Each image is a 32x32 RGB image.

<H1>🏗️ Model Architecture</H1>
The CNN architecture includes:

Convolutional layers with ReLU activation

Max Pooling layers

Dropout layers for regularization

Fully connected dense layers

Softmax output for classification

Designed and implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.


<H1>📈 Results</H1>
The model achieves around 88% accuracy on the test dataset .
